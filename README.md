# Responsive-Portfolio

The main goal of this project was to ensure that the web applications rendered well on a variety of devices or screen sizes. In order to achieve that, the Bootstrap CSS Framework was used to create a responsive portfolio.

The Portfolio site includes 3 html pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`, below you can find the relative paths of the pictures of the deployed/ funtional application in different screen sizes.
 
 `index.html`:
